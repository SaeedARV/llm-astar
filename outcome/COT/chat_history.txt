PROMPT & INCONTEXT SAMPLES
You are an AI assistant specialized in planning collision-free paths for drones in a two-dimensional environment. You will be given a specific start point, end points and circular obstable position with size.Your task is to calculate a path from the start point to the end point that avoids any circular, static obstacles. Your solution should be a sequence of points in the format of [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xn, yn]], forming a safe and efficient route to ensure collision-free movement. The path should be a series of straight lines between consecutive points, avoiding all circular obstacles' areas. Here are 3 examples.
design a path from [10, 0] to [0, 10] that avoids crossing the area of circle centered at [5, 5] with a radius of 4.
> Let's think step by step. To avoid the circular obstacle at [5, 5] with a radius of 4, we need to find an additional point in between the start and end points. [0, 0] connects [10, 0] and [0, 10] without crossing the circular obstacle. Therefore, the final path is [[10, 0], [0, 0], [0, 10]].
design a path from [80, 40] to [-10, 10] that avoids crossing the area of circle centered at [32, 32] with a radius of 30.
> Let's think step by step. To avoid the circular obstacle at [32, 32] with a radius of 30, we need to find an additional point in between the start and end points. [40, -10] connects [80, 40] and [-10, 10] without crossing the circular obstacle. Therefore, the final path is [[80, 40], [40, -10], [-10, 10]].
design a path from [-2, 27] to [3, -50] that avoids crossing the area of circle centered at [-19, 6] with a radius of 23.
> Let's think step by step. To avoid the circular obstacle at [-19, 6] with a radius of 23.68112539820996, we need to find an additional point in between the start and end points. [20, 0] connects [-2, 27] and [3, -50] without crossing the circular obstacle. Therefore, the final path is [[-2, 27], [20, 0], [3, -50]].

Here is the task.

CHAT HISTORY WITH GPT-3.5

CHAT-1
User> design a path from [32, -18] to [-47, 23] that avoids crossing the area of circle centered at [-20, 3] with a radius of 13.

GPT> Let's think step by step. To avoid the circular obstacle at [-20, 3] with a radius of 13, we need to find an additional point in between the start and end points. [-10, 0] connects [32, -18] and [-47, 23] without crossing the circular obstacle. Therefore, the final path is [[32, -18], [-10, 0], [-47, 23]].

CHAT-2
User> design a path from [-25, -25] to [49, 39] that avoids crossing the area of circle centered at [41, 30] with a radius of 3.

GPT> Let's think step by step. To avoid the circular obstacle at [41, 30] with a radius of 3, we need to find an additional point in between the start and end points. [0, 0] connects [-25, -25] and [49, 39] without crossing the circular obstacle. Therefore, the final path is [[-25, -25], [0, 0], [49, 39]].
