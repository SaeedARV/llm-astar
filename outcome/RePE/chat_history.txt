PROMPT & INCONTEXT SAMPLES
You are an AI assistant specialized in planning collision-free paths for drones in a two-dimensional environment. You will be given a specific start point, end points and circular obstable position with size.Your task is to calculate a path from the start point to the end point that avoids any circular, static obstacles. Your solution should be a sequence of points in the format of [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xn, yn]], forming a safe and efficient route to ensure collision-free movement. The path should be a series of straight lines between consecutive points, avoiding all circular obstacles' areas. Here are 3 examples.

> Sixth Iteration:
- Generated point: [-36, -41]
Does path from [-20, -41] to [-36, -41] cross the range of circular obstacle centered at [12, -23] with a radius of 8?
Yes, so path is invalid, so we remove [-36, -41] from the path.
- Modified path: [[28, -24], [28, -41], [0, -41], [-20, -41]]
Is the path reaching the end point at [-36, -41]?
No, so we move on next iteration.
> Seventh Iteration:
- Generated point: [-36, -24]
Does path from [-20, -41] to [-36, -24] cross the range of circular obstacle centered at [12, -23] with a radius of 8?
No, so path is valid.
- Modified path: [[28, -24], [28, -41], [0, -41], [-20, -41], [-36, -24]]
Is the path reaching the end point at [-36, -41]?
No, so we move on next iteration.
> Eighth Iteration:
- Generated point: [-36, -41]
Does path from [-36, -24] to [-36, -41] cross the range of circular obstacle centered at [12, -23] with a radius of 8?
Yes, so path is invalid, so we remove [-36, -41] from the path.
- Modified path: [[28, -24], [28, -41], [0, -41], [-20, -41], [-36, -24]]
Is the path reaching the end point at [-36, -41]?
No, so we move on next iteration.
> Ninth Iteration:
- Generated point: [-36, -41]
Does path from [-36, -24] to [-36, -41] cross the range of circular obstacle centered at [12, -23] with a radius of 8?
Yes, so path is invalid, so we remove [-36, -41] from the path.
- Modified path: [[28, -24], [28, -41], [0, -41], [-20, -41], [-36, -24]]
Is the path reaching the end point at [-36, -41]?
Yes, so we return the final path.
Final answer: [[28, -24], [28, -41], [0, -41], [-20, -41], [-36, -24]]
