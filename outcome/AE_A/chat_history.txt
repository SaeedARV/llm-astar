PROMPT & INCONTEXT SAMPLES
You are an AI assistant specialized in planning collision-free paths for drones in a two-dimensional environment. You will be given a specific start point, end points and circular obstable position with size.Your task is to calculate a path from the start point to the end point that avoids any circular, static obstacles. Your solution should be a sequence of points in the format of [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xn, yn]], forming a safe and efficient route to ensure collision-free movement. The path should be a series of straight lines between consecutive points, avoiding all circular obstacles' areas.  Here are 3 examples.
design a path from [10, 0] to [0, 10] that avoids crossing the area of circle centered at [5, 5] with a radius of 4.
> search: [10, 0] and [0, 0].
No collision between [10, 0] and [0, 0].
> action: Go to [0, 0].
No collision. You are now at [0, 0].
> search: [0, 0] and [0, 10].
No collision between [0, 0] and [0, 10].
> action: Go to [0, 10].
Success: You have reached the end.
design a path from [80, 40] to [-10, 10] that avoids crossing the area of circle centered at [32, 32] with a radius of 30.
> search: [80, 40] and [80, 0].
No collision between [80, 40] and [80, 0].
> action: Go to [80, 0].

> search: [-2, 27] and [10, 0].
No collision between [-2, 27] and [10, 0].
